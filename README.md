# forward-forward-experiments
The forward-forward algorithm, developed by Geoffrey Hinton (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345), is an experimental alternative to backpropagation that showed some success at replicating its performance. There are various PyTorch implementations of this algorithm on GitHub and elsewhere, and my implementation of the basic algorithm is based on those of Mohammad Pezeshki (available at https://github.com/mohammadpz/pytorch_forward_forward) and Vivik V Patel (available at https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/mnist_forward_forward). My purpose is not to add another such implementation, but to demonstrate some potential modifications to the algorithm, including minibatch training and a currently unfinished novel method of generating negative training data.
